# Academia Tecnica Capgemini 2022 - DESAFIO DE PROGRAMACAO

## Contextualization
 `Warning:` as required in the challenge, this repository is Public, so, anyone can read it and, of course, copy all of the code. I believe that you are expecting this behavior.
 
 This repository is the place I uploaded my solutions to this challenge.
 
 My solutions are organized in the folders, each one providing specific information about each questions.
 
 This is the folder structure:

- [`Questão 1`: Drawing a stair of \*](./question_1)
- [`Questão 2`: Helping Débora with her password ](./question_2)
- [`Questão 3`: Pairs of anagrams ](./question_3)

## Development environment

As I don't know how the tests and evaluations will be done, it is important to describe the environment where these solutions where developed and tested.

It's important to remember that all my files were saved in the UNIX carriage return/line feed format.

To develop my solutions and to make my tests, I used the following environment:
```
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bison-elk-cougar-mlk X54)
```
```
GNU bash, version 4.4.20(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
```
```
gedit 40.1-14-g0850b4ae32, with Highlight mode to PHP code.
```
```
PHP 7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.10 (cli) (built: Oct 25 2021 17:47:59) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.10, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
```
## Preliminary analysis

- To test my solutions, INPUT data must be insert, accordingly, in the code.
- There isn't information, in the challenge description, explaining how do you will make tests. 
- At each folder, to each question, I have made other analysis, concerning that specific question. 

## Final thoughts

This documentation was made directly at GitHub editor, using some MarkDown resources.

## Contextualization
 `Warning:` as required in the challenge, this repository is Public, so, anyone can read it and, of course, copy all of the code. I believe that you are expecting this behavior.
 
 This repository is the place I uploaded my solutions to this challenge.
 My solutions are organized in folders, where:

- question_1
  - in this folder, there are files with my solution to question 1
  - there is a file README.md with my analysis.

- question_2
  - in this folder, there are files with my solution to question 2
  - there is a file README.md with my analysis.

- question_3
  - in this folder, there are files with my solution to question 3
  - there is a file README.md with my analysis.

## Development environment

As I don't know how the tests and evaluations will be done, it is important to describe the environment where these solutions where developed and tested.

It's important to remember that all my files were saved in the UNIX carriage return/line feed format.

To develop my solutions and to make my tests, I used the following environment:
```
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bison-elk-cougar-mlk X54)
```
```
GNU bash, version 4.4.20(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
```
```
gedit 40.1-14-g0850b4ae32, with Highlight mode to PHP code.
```
```
